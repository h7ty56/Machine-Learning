        "\n",
        "1. Visual inspection: Plot the data and the fitted model to visually assess the fit.\n",
        "2. R-squared (R¬≤): Measure the proportion of variance explained by the model.\n",
        "3. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Calculate the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "4. Cross-validation: Evaluate model performance on unseen data to assess generalizability.\n",
        "5. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC): Compare models based on their relative quality.\n",
        "6. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): Similar to AIC, but penalizes complex models more heavily.\n",
        "Considerations\n",
        "When evaluating model fit, consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Balance between fit and complexity: Avoid overfitting by balancing model fit with model complexity.\n",
        "2. Model assumptions: Ensure that the model assumptions are met.\n",

        "By using these methods, researchers can select the optimal degree of a polynomial model that balances fit and complexity."
